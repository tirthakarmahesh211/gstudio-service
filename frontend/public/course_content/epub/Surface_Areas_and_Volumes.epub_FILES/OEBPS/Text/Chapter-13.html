    <p>Wherever we look, usually we see solids. So far, in all our study, we have been dealing with figures that can be easily drawn on our notebooks or blackboards. These are called plane figures. We have understood what rectangles, squares and circles are, what we mean by their perimeters and areas, and how we can find them. We have learnt these in earlier classes. It would be interesting to see what happens if we cut out many of these plane figures of the same shape and size from cardboard sheet and stack them up in a vertical pile. By this process, we shall obtain some solid figures (briefly called solids) such as a cuboid, a cylinder, etc. In the earlier classes, you have also learnt to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids, cubes and cylinders. We shall now learn to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids and cylinders in details and extend this study to some other solids such as cones and spheres.</p>

    <p class="topicHeading"><b>13.2 Surface Area of a Cuboid and a Cube</b></p>

    <p>Have you looked at a bundle of many sheets of paper? How does it look? Does it look like what you see in Fig. 13.1?</p>

    <div class="image">
      <img alt="131" src="../Images/131.png" /><br />
    </div>

    <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.1</p>

    <p>That makes up a cuboid. How much of brown paper would you need, if you want to cover this cuboid? Let us see:</p>

    <p>First we would need a rectangular piece to cover the bottom of the bundle. That would be as shown in Fig. 13.2(a).</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="886.png" src="../Images/886.png" /></div>

    <p class="caption"><br /></p>

    <p>Then we would need two long rectangular pieces to cover the two side ends. Now, it would look like Fig. 13.2 (b).</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="897.png" src="../Images/897.png" /></div>

    <p>Now to cover the front and back ends, we would need two more rectangular pieces of a different size. With them, we would now have a figure as shown in Fig. 13.2(c).</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="906.png" src="../Images/906.png" /></div>

    <p>This figure, when opened out, would look like Fig. 13.2 (d).</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="917.png" src="../Images/917.png" /></div>

    <p>Finally, to cover the top of the bundle, we would require another rectangular piece exactly like the one at the bottom, which if we attach on the right side, it would look like Fig. 13.2(e).</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="926.png" src="../Images/926.png" /></div>

    <p>So we have used six rectangular pieces to cover the complete outer surface of the cuboid.</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="868.png" src="../Images/868.png" /></div>

    <div class="image">
      <span class="caption">Fig. 13.2</span><br />
    </div>

    <p>This shows us that the outer surface of a cuboid is made up of six rectangles (in fact, rectangular regions, called the faces of the cuboid), whose areas can be found by multiplying length by breadth for each of them separately and then adding the six areas together.</p>

    <p>Now, if we take the length of the cuboid as l, breadth as b and the height as h, then the figure with these dimensions would be like the shape you see in Fig. 13.2(f).</p>

    <p>So, the sum of the areas of the six rectangles is:</p>

    <p>Area of rectangle 1 (= l × h)</p>

    <p>+</p>

    <p>Area of rectangle 2 (= l × b)</p>

    <p>+</p>

    <p>Area of rectangle 3 (= l × h)</p>

    <p>+</p>

    <p>Area of rectangle 4 (= l × b)</p>

    <p>+</p>

    <p>Area of rectangle 5 (= b × h)</p>

    <p>+</p>

    <p>Area of rectangle 6 (= b × h)</p>

    <p>= 2(l × b) + 2(b × h) + 2(l × h)</p>

    <p>= 2(lb + bh + hl)</p>

    <p>This gives us:</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <div class="lining_box">
      <b>Surface Area of a Cuboid = 2(lb + bh + hl)</b>
    </div>

    <p>where l, b and h are respectively the three edges of the cuboid.</p>

    <p><strong class="SubHeading">Note :</strong> The unit of area is taken as the square unit, because we measure the magnitude of a region by filling it with squares of side of unit length.</p>

    <p>For example, if we have a cuboid whose length, breadth and height are 15 cm,<br />
    10 cm and 20 cm respectively, then its surface area would be:</p>

    <p>2[(15 × 10) + (10 × 20) + (20 × 15)]cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>= 2(150 + 200 + 300)cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>= 2 × 650cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>= 1300cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>Recall that a cuboid, whose length, breadth and height are all equal, is called a cube. If each edge of the cube is a, then the surface area of this cube would be</p>

    <p>2(a × a + a × a + a × a), i.e., 6a<sup>2</sup> (see Fig. 13.3), giving us</p>

    <div class="lining_box">
      <p><b>Surface Area of a Cube = 6a<sup>2</sup></b></p>
    </div>

    <p>where a is the edge of the cube.</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="981.png" src="../Images/981.png" /></div>

    <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.3</p>

    <p>Suppose, out of the six faces of a cuboid, we only find the area of the four faces, leaving the bottom and top faces. In such a case, the area of these four faces is called the <b>lateral surface area</b> of the cuboid. So, lateral surface area of a cuboid of length l, breadth b and height h is equal to <i>2lh + 2bh or 2(l + b)h</i>. Similarly, lateral surface area of a cube of side a is equal to 4a<sup>2</sup>.</p>

    <p>Keeping in view of the above, the surface area of a cuboid (or a cube) is sometimes also referred to as the total surface area. Let us now solve some examples.</p>

    <p><strong class="SubHeading">Example 1 :</strong> Mary wants to decorate her Christmas tree. She wants to place the tree on a wooden box covered with coloured paper with picture of Santa Claus on it (see Fig. 13.4).</p>

    <div>
      <div class="image">
        <img alt="134" src="../Images/134.png" /><br />
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.4</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>She must know the exact quantity of paper to buy for this purpose. If the box has length, breadth and height as 80 cm, 40 cm and 20 cm respectively how many square sheets of paper of side 40 cm would she require?</p>

    <p><strong class="SubHeading">Solution :</strong> Since Mary wants to paste the paper on the outer surface of the box; the quantity of paper required would be equal to the surface area of the box which is of the shape of a cuboid. The dimensions of the box are:</p>

    <p>Length = 80 cm, Breadth = 40 cm, Height = 20 cm.</p>

    <p>The surface area of the box = 2(lb + bh + hl)</p>

    <p>= 2[(80 × 40) + (40 × 20) + (20 × 80)]cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>= 2[3200 + 800 + 1600]cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>= 2 × 5600cm<sup>2</sup> = 11200cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>The area of each sheet of the paper = 40 × 40cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>= 1600cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>Therefore, number of sheets required = <img alt="1783.png" src="../Images/1783.png" style="text-align: center;" /></p>

    <div class="image">
      <img alt="chap13img1" src="../Images/chap13img1.png" /><br />
    </div>

    <p>So, she would require 7 sheets.</p>

    <p><strong class="SubHeading">Example 2 :</strong> Hameed has built a cubical water tank with lid for his house, with each outer edge 1.5 m long. He gets the outer surface of the tank excluding the base, covered with square tiles of side 25 cm (see Fig. 13.5). Find how much he would spend for the tiles, if the cost of the tiles is Rs 360 per dozen.</p>

    <div>
      <div class="image"><img alt="1040.png" src="../Images/1040.png" /></div>

      <div>
        <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.5</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><strong class="SubHeading">Solution :</strong> Since Hameed is getting the five outer faces of the tank covered with tiles, he would need to know the surface area of the tank, to decide on the number of tiles required.</p>

    <p>Edge of the cubical tank = 1.5 m = 150 cm (= a)</p>

    <p>So, surface area of the tank = 5 × 150 × 150cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>Area of each square tile = side × side = 25 × 25cm<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>So, the number of tiles required = <span><img alt="1793.png" src="../Images/1793.png" style="widt:30%;" /></span></p>

    <p>= <span><img alt="1798.png" src="../Images/1798.png" style="widt:20%;" /></span> = 180</p>

    <p>Cost of 1 dozen tiles, i.e., cost of 12 tiles = Rs 360</p>

    <p>Therefore, cost of one tile = Rs <span><img alt="1803.png" src="../Images/1803.png" style="widt:5%;" /></span> = Rs 30</p>

    <p>So, the cost of 180 tiles = 180 × Rs 30 = Rs 5400</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p><b><span class="topicHeading">13.3 Surface Area of a Right Circular Cylinder</span></b></p>

    <p>If we take a number of circular sheets of paper and stack them up as we stacked up rectangular sheets earlier, what would we get (see Fig. 13.6)?</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="1114.png" src="../Images/1114.png" /></div>

    <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.6</p>

    <p>Here, if the stack is kept vertically up, we get what is called a right circular cylinder, since it has been kept at right angles to the base, and the base is circular. Let us see what kind of cylinder is not a right circular cylinder.</p>

    <p>In Fig 13.7 (a), you see a cylinder, which is certainly circular, but it is not at right angles to the base. So, we can not say this a right circular cylinder. of course, if we have a cylinder with a non circular base, as you see in Fig. 13.7 (b), then we also cannot call it a right circular cylinder.</p>

    <div class="image">
      <img alt="1372" src="../Images/1372.png" /><br />
    </div>

    <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.7</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Remark :</strong> Here, we will be dealing with only right circular cylinders. So, unless stated otherwise, the word cylinder would mean a right circular cylinder.</p>

  <p>Now, if a cylinder is to be covered with coloured paper, how will we do it with the minimum amount of paper? First take a rectangular sheet of paper, whose length is just enough to go round the cylinder and whose breadth is equal to the height of the cylinder as shown in Fig. 13.8.</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="1085.png" src="../Images/1085.png" /></div>

  <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.8</p>

  <p>The area of the sheet gives us the curved surface area of the cylinder. Note that the length of the sheet is equal to the circumference of the circular base which is equal to 2πr.</p>

  <p>So, curved surface area of the cylinder</p>

  <p>= area of the rectangular sheet = length × breadth</p>

  <p>= perimeter of the base of the cylinder × h</p>

  <p>= 2πr × h</p>

  <p>Therefore,</p>

  <p><b class="lining_box">Curved Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πrh</b></p>

  <p>where r is the radius of the base of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.</p>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Remark :</strong> In the case of a cylinder, unless stated otherwise, ‘radius of a cylinder’ shall mean’ base radius of the cylinder’.</p>

  <p>If the top and the bottom of the cylinder are also to be covered, then we need two circles (infact, circular regions) to do that, each of radius r, and thus having an area of πr<sup>2</sup> each (see Fig. 13.9), giving us the total surface area as 2πrh + 2πr<sup>2</sup> = 2πr(r + h).</p>

    <div>
      <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.9</p>
    </div>

  <p>So,</p>

  <p><b class="lining_box">Total Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr(r + h)</b></p>

  <p>where h is the height of the cylinder and r its radius.</p>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Remark :</strong> You may recall from Chapter 1 that π is an irrational number. So, the value of π is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal. But when we use its value in our calculations, we usually take its value as approximately equal to <span><img alt="1808.png" src="../Images/1808.png" style="widt:5%;" /></span> or 3.14.</p>

  <p>So far, we have been generating solids by stacking up congruent figures. Incidentally, such figures are called prisms. Now let us look at another kind of solid which is not a prism. (These kinds of solids are called pyramids). Let us see how we can generate them.</p>

  <p><b class="SubHeading">Activity :</b> Cut out a right-angled triangle ABC right angled at B. Paste a long thick string along one of the perpendicular sides say AB of the triangle [see Fig. 13.13(a)].

Do you recognize the shape that the triangle is forming as it rotates around the string [see Fig. 13.13(b)]?

  <p>This is called a right circular cone. In Fig. 13.13(c) of the right circular cone, the point A is called the vertex, AB is called the height, BC is called the radius and AC is called the slant height of the cone. Here B will be the centre of circular base of the cone. The height, radius and slant height of the cone are usually denoted by h, r and l respectively. Once again, let us see what kind of cone we can not call a right circular cone. Here, you are (see Fig. 13.14)!</p>

  <p>(iv) Now the area of each triangle = <span><br /></span><img alt="1848.png" src="../Images/1848.png" style="widt:5%;" /><span style="text-align: left;">× base of each triangle × l.</span></p>

  <p>So, area of the entire piece of paper</p>

  <p>= sum of the areas of all the triangles</p>

  <p>= <span><img alt="1838.png" src="../Images/1838.png" style="widt:30%;" /></span> = <span><img alt="1843.png" src="../Images/1843.png" style="widt:30%;" /></span></p>

  <p>(as b<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub> + b<sub>3</sub> + . . . makes up the curved portion of the figure)</p>

  <p>But the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone and the circumference of the base of the cone = 2πr, where r is the base radius of the cone.</p>

  <p>So,</p>

  <p class="lining_box"><b>Curved Surface Area of a Cone = <span><img alt="1853.png" src="../Images/1853.png" style="widt:5%;" /></span> × l × 2πr = πrl</b></p>

  <p>where r is its base radius and l its slant height.</p>

  <p>Note that l<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup> + h<sup>2</sup> (as can be seen from Fig. 13.16), by applying Pythagoras Theorem. Here h is the height of the cone.</p>

  <p>Therefore, l = <span><img alt="1858.png" src="../Images/1858.png" style="widt:30%;" /></span></p>

  <p>Now if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r is also required whose area is πr<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p><b class="topicHeading">13.5 Surface Area of a Sphere</b></p>

  <p>What is a sphere? Is it the same as a circle? Can you draw a circle on a paper? Yes, you can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant distance (called radius) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle. Now if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had rotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 13.18). What does it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere.</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="1318" src="../Images/1318.png" /><br />
  </div>

  <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.18</p>

  <p>Can you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on rotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three dimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space, which lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the centre of the sphere.</p>

  <p><b class="SubHeading">Note :</b> A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the solid whose surface is a sphere.</p>

  <p><b class="SubHeading">Activity :</b> Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone play with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take a rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string around the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep the string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball, till you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 13.19(a)]. Mark the starting and finishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball.</p>

  <p>Now, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which you easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper, draw four circles with radius equal to the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had wound around the ball [see Fig. 13.19(b)].</p>

  <div class="image">

  <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.19</p>

  <p>What have you achieved in all this?</p>

  <p>The string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been used to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.</p>

  <p>So, what does that mean? This suggests that the surface area of a sphere of radius r</p>

  <p>= 4 times the area of a circle of radius r = 4 × (πr<sup>2</sup>)</p>

  <p>So,</p>

  <p class="lining_box"><b>Surface Area of a Sphere = 4 πr<sup>2</sup></b></p>

  <p>where r is the radius of the sphere.</p>

  <p>How many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere? There is only one, which is curved.</p>

  <p>Now, let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly ‘through the middle’ with a plane that passes through its centre. What happens to the sphere?</p>

  <p>Yes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 13.20) ! What will each half be called? It is called a <b>hemisphere.</b> (Because ‘hemi’ also means ‘half’)</p>

  <p>And what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have?</p>

  <p>Two! There is a curved face and a flat face (base).</p>

  <p>The curved surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which is <span><img alt="1904.png" src="../Images/1904.png" style="widt:5%;" /></span> of 4πr<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p class="lining_box"><b>Curved Surface Area of a Hemisphere = 2πr<sup>2</sup></b></p>

  <p class="topicHeading"><b>13.6 Volume of a Cuboid</b></p>

  <p>You have already learnt about volumes of certain figures (objects) in earlier classes. Recall that solid objects occupy space. The measure of this occupied space is called the <b>Volume</b> of the object.</p>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Note :</strong> If an object is solid, then the space occupied by such an object is measured, and is termed the <b>Volume</b> of the object. On the other hand, if the object is hollow, then interior is empty, and can be filled with air, or some liquid that will take the shape of its container. In this case, the volume of the substance that can fill the interior is called <b>the capacity of the container</b>. In short, the volume of an object is the measure of the space it occupies, and the capacity of an object is the volume of substance its interior can accommodate. Hence, the unit of measurement of either of the two is cubic unit.</p>

  <p>So, if we were to talk of the volume of a cuboid, we would be considering the measure of the space occupied by the cuboid.</p>

  <p>Further, the area or the volume is measured as the magnitude of a region. So, correctly speaking, we should be finding the area of a circular region, or volume of a cuboidal region, or volume of a spherical region, etc. But for the sake of simplicity, we say, find the area of a circle, volume of a cuboid or a sphere even though these mean only their boundaries.</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="1475.png" src="../Images/1475.png" /></div>

  <div class="image">

  <p>Observe Fig. 13.23. Suppose we say that the area of each rectangle is A, the height up to which the rectangles are stacked is h and the volume of the cuboid is V. Can you tell what would be the relationship between V, A and h?</p>

  <p>The area of the plane region occupied by each rectangle × height</p>

  <p>= Measure of the space occupied by the cuboid</p>

  <p>So, we get A × h = V</p>

  <p>That is,</p>

  <p class="lining_box"><b>Volume of a Cuboid = base area × height = length × breadth × height</b></p>

  <p>or l × b × h, where l, b and h are respectively the length, breadth and height of the cuboid.</p>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Note :</strong> When we measure the magnitude of the region of a space, that is, the space occupied by a solid, we do so by counting the number of cubes of edge of unit length that can fit into it exactly. Therefore, the unit of measurement of volume is cubic unit.</p>

  <p>Again</p>

  <p class="lining_box"><b>Volume of a Cube = edge × edge × edge = a<sup>3</sup></b></p>

  <p>where a is the edge of the cube (see Fig. 13.24).</p>

  <p>then volume of the cube = 12 × 12 × 12 cm<sup>3</sup></p>

  <p>= 1728 cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

  <p>Recall that you have learnt these formulae in earlier classes. Now let us take some examples to illustrate the use of these formulae:</p>

If this wall is to be built up with bricks whose dimensions are 24 cm × 12 cm × 8 cm, how many bricks would be required?</p>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Solution :</strong> Since the wall with all its bricks makes up the space occupied by it, we need to find the volume of the wall, which is nothing but a cuboid.</p>

  <p>Here, Length = 10 m = 1000 cm</p>

  <p>Thickness = 24 cm</p>

  <p>Height = 4 m = 400 cm</p>

  <p>Therefore, Volume of the wall = length × thickness × height</p>

  <p>= 1000 × 24 × 400 cm<sup>3</sup></p>

  <p>Now, each brick is a cuboid with length = 24 cm, breadth = 12 cm and height = 8 cm</p>

  <p>So, volume of each brick = length × breadth × height</p>

  <p>= 24 × 12 × 8 cm<sup>3</sup></p>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Solution :</strong> Since the concrete mixture that is to be used to build up the pillars is going to occupy the entire space of the pillar, what we need to find here is the volume of the cylinders.</p>

  <p>Radius of base of a cylinder = 20 cm</p>

  <p>Height of the cylindrical pillar = 10 m = 1000 cm</p>

  <p>So, volume of each cylinder = πr<sup>2</sup>h</p>

  <p>So, let us start like this.</p>

  <p>Fill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder. We find that it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 13.29(a)].</p>

  <p>When we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see that the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 13.29(b)].</p>

  <p>With this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a cone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the same height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the cylinder.</p>

  <p>So,</p>

  <p><strong class="SubHeading">Solution :</strong> Since the area of the canvas = 551m<sup>2</sup> and area of the canvas lost in wastage is 1m<sup>2</sup>, therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is<br />
  (551 – 1)m<sup>2</sup> = 550m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>Now, the surface area of the tent = 550m<sup>2</sup> and the required base radius of the conical tent = 7 m</p>

  <p>Note that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by canvas!!).</p>

  <p>Therefore, curved surface area of tent = 550m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>That is, πrl = 550</p>

  <p class="topicHeading"><b>13.9 Volume of a Sphere</b></p>

  <p>Now, let us see how to go about measuring the volume of a sphere. First, take two or three spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of the spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the container. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 13.30(a)].</p>

  <p>Now, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from the container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 13.30(b)]. Carefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated cylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 13.30(c)]. Suppose the radius of the immersed sphere is r (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter of the sphere). Then evaluate <span><img alt="2047.png" src="../Images/2047.png" style="widt:5%;" /></span> πr3. Do you find this value almost equal to the measure of the volume over flowed?</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="1330" src="../Images/1330.png" /><br />
  </div>

  <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Fig. 13.30</p>

  <p>Once again repeat the procedure done just now, with a different size of sphere. Find the radius R of this sphere and then calculate the value of <span><img alt="2052.png" src="../Images/2052.png" style="widt:10%;" /></span> Once again this value is nearly equal to the measure of the volume of the water displaced (over flowed) by the sphere. What does this tell us? We know that the volume of the sphere is the same as the measure of the volume of the water displaced by it. By doing this experiment repeatedly with spheres of varying radii, we are getting the same result, namely, the volume of a sphere is equal to <span><img alt="2057.png" src="../Images/2057.png" style="widt:10%;" /></span> times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea that</p>

  <p class="lining_box"><b>Volume of a Sphere = <span><img alt="2062.png" src="../Images/2062.png" style="widt:10%;" /></span></b></p>

  <p>where r is the radius of the sphere.</p>

  <p>Later, in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it as true.</p>

  <p>Since a hemisphere is half of a sphere, can you guess what the volume of a hemisphere will be? Yes, it= <span><img alt="2072.png" src="../Images/2072.png" style="widt:5%;" /></span>πr3.</p>
